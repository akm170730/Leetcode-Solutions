/*
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points.
After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.
You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
6 total points are earned.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
